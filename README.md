Hello World!

Hi there. Ali here. I am having tons of fun with Web Development in Laravel! 
Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework that follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern for developing web applications. If you are a Web Artisan you are surely going to love it!


Good Luck!
